# NGordNet
Implemented generic Abstract Data Structures in Java to analyze the hyponyms, relative popularity of words, categories &amp; lengths of words over time using Zipf's law. Effectively utilized the semantic lexicon WordNet, Google's Ngram dataset and TimeSeries with an YearlyRecord to aid the NGordNet User Interface.
